Abstract
The Drug Inventory and Supply Chain Management System aims to revolutionize the pharmaceutical sector by automating and securing the inventory tracking and drug supply chain processes. This system reduces the chances of drug shortages, overstocking, and expired medication, improving healthcare delivery through real-time data, AI-based forecasting, and blockchain-backed security.

Key Features:
Real-Time Inventory Monitoring

Expiration Alert System

Supply Chain Transparency

Role-Based Access for Stakeholders

Predictive Demand Forecasting

Technologies Used:
Frontend: React.js (Web) / Kotlin (Mobile)

Backend: Django (REST APIs), Node.js (Microservices)

Database: MySQL

Blockchain: Ethereum Smart Contracts (Solidity)

AI Module: TensorFlow / Scikit-learn for stock prediction

Use Cases:
Pharmacies: Monitor real-time stock levels.

Hospitals: Automated medicine reordering.

Distributors: Trace drug movement and prevent counterfeit supply.

Regulatory Bodies: Ensure compliance and track lifecycle of drugs.

📖 Chapter 1: Introduction
1.1 Overview
This project automates pharmaceutical inventory and supply chain processes. It ensures availability, minimizes wastage, and adds traceability from manufacture to distribution using software and blockchain technology.

1.2 Problem Statement
Manual inventory management often leads to:

Overstocking or stockouts

Medication expiration

Lack of real-time visibility

Vulnerability to counterfeit drugs

This system solves these problems through automation and secure data tracking.

1.3 Objectives
Design a real-time drug inventory management system

Develop blockchain-based traceability

Implement expiry prediction and alert mechanisms

Enable role-based access for various stakeholders

1.4 Scope
Used across:

Local pharmacies for automated reordering

Hospitals for stock monitoring

Distributors for supply tracking

Government bodies for regulatory compliance

📚 Chapter 2: Literature Survey
2.1 Existing Solutions
Manual Excel systems or ERPs (prone to error)

RFID-based tracking (expensive, limited scalability)

Cold chain systems (often fragmented)

2.2 Modern Approaches
Blockchain for tamper-proof logging

AI for inventory forecasting

Cloud APIs for supplier integration

2.3 Gaps in Existing Work
Lack of decentralized systems

Poor integration with mobile-first solutions

Limited use of AI in demand forecasting

🔧 Chapter 3: Proposed System
3.1 System Overview
The system features a real-time dashboard, drug verification, and supply traceability using smart contracts and databases.

3.2 Components
Frontend (React.js/Kotlin): User dashboard and mobile access

Backend (Django/Node.js): Inventory APIs, expiry checks

Blockchain Layer: Tamper-proof transactions

AI Layer: Demand prediction using historical data

3.3 Architecture
Input Module: Drug entry, supplier info

Processing Module: Inventory sync, blockchain transactions

Output Module: Reports, notifications, alerts

🧪 Chapter 4: Implementation - Phase 1
✅ UI/UX Design
Admin Dashboard

Pharmacist Portal

Drug Detail Pages

Alert and Report Screens

🔄 Backend Development
Drug database with expiry tracking

Django REST APIs

Role-based user authentication

🚀 Blockchain Integration
Smart contract to log drug batches and transfers

Role-based access (Manufacturer, Distributor, Pharmacy)

📋 Next Steps
🧠 AI Model Training
Use TensorFlow to forecast drug demand based on usage trends.

📦 Final Backend Integration
Real-time stock updates

Expiry prediction logic

📱 Mobile App Development
Kotlin app with barcode scanner

Offline mode using local DB sync

✅ Final Testing & Deployment
Unit and system testing

Deployment on testnet and local pharmacy

📌 Goal
Build and deploy a fully functional drug inventory and supply chain management system that ensures reliability, transparency, and efficiency across the pharmaceutical domain.
